This is my capstone project for the Web3 Builders Alliance cohort (08/2022 - 10/2022).

Problem:

1. Wallets rely on off-chain services to determine if they own a specific NFT.
2. In addition, users are dependent on third party dapps to sell their NFTs.

Solution:
I've created a wallet that generates an NFT deposit smart contract which:

1. Allow wallets to determine NFT ownership by querying the blockchain instead of relying on off-chain services.
2. Allow interested parties to directly bid on NFTs in the NFT deposit contract.
